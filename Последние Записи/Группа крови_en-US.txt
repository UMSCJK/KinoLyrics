Blood type (1988)
Lyrics by: Viktor Robertovich Tsoi
Composed by: Viktor Robertovich Tsoi

It's such a warm place but there on the street,
Where our footprints are waited for,
Stardusted boots
sparkle and shine.
Here are the shepherds and upholstered chair,
Dazzling dreams below the bright sun orb;
The trigger untouched
when it was the right time.

[Chorus]

I am able to pay but I never want
A triumph at any price,
I never want
someone's chest lying under my foot.
I would rather stay here with you,
Just to stay here with you,
But the star which is high in the skies
still gives me the route.

[Chorus]

Chorus:
My blood type mark is on the sleeve,
There's my ordinal number marked on the sleeve.
Wish me now some luck in the fight,
Sayin' now, sayin'
I won't stay in this field of green,
I won't stay in this field of green,
Wish me now to be lucky,
Sayin' now, sayin' "Be lucky!"
